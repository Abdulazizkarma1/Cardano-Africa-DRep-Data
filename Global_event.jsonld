    "comment": "Cardano Africa DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund the “Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano,” based on the rationale below:\n\nCardano’s fragmented event presence has been a recurring weakness in our outreach and brand positioning. While individual Catalyst-funded initiatives have value, the lack of a unified, Cardano branded global strategy has limited our visibility compared to competing ecosystems. This proposal directly addresses that gap by consolidating event marketing under a coordinated, Cardano-first approach, ensuring that our identity is front and center at high impact gatherings.\n\nThe vendor consortium, Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, and Rare Network brings credibility, event execution expertise, and ecosystem alignment. Their track record in community building, business development, and brand elevation gives confidence in delivery.\n\nWhile ₳6M is a significant investment, the scope, duration, and global reach justify the cost. Cardano is competing against well-funded rivals who leverage consistent branding and event presence to capture market share. \n\nfor these reasons, we vote YES\n\n"
