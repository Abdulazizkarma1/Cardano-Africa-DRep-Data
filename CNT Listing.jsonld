    "comment": "Cardano Africa DRep votes NO on this governance action to withdraw ₳3,126,000 for the “Ecosystem Exchange Listing and Market Making service” administered by Intersect, based on the rationale below:\n\nThe problems cited \"lack of top-tier market makers and exchange listings\" are symptoms of adoption and demand, not the cause. Forcing listings through large lump sum payments risks wasting treasury funds on short-lived exposure without the ecosystem maturity to retain user interest or liquidity. In most cases, the exchanges themselves will require ongoing volumes and incentives, a one-time listing fee does not guarantee sustainable markets.\n\nGiven the size of the ask, the reliance on third party validation without true market accountability, and the unclear ROI for the Cardano community as a whole, this proposal represents a poor use of treasury resources. Treasury funds should focus on infrastructure, tooling, and adoption pathways that benefit all projects"
