    "comment": "Cardano Africa DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund Cardano Builder DAO with ₳12M, administered by Intersect, based on the rationale below:\n\nCardano’s application layer is starving for sustained, strategic funding. We’ve had years of protocol-level innovation, Catalyst rounds, and hackathons, but the projects already delivering real users and daily on-chain activity are still left to fend for themselves. This proposal is a direct attempt to close that gap.\n\n₳12M is a serious ask, but the structure, PSSC controlled disbursements, DAO governance, and public KPI reporting make this a calculated investment, not a blind expense. If executed well, the outcome will be measurable: more daily active wallets, higher TVL, greater DeFi liquidity, and stronger retention of developer talent."
